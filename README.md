#  Collaborative Canvas

A **real-time collaborative drawing board** built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **Socket.IO**, and **HTML5 Canvas**.  
Multiple users can draw together live — every stroke, cursor move, and erase action is synced instantly.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dupta/collaborative-canvas.git
cd collaborative-canvas
npm install
npm start

## Then open:
http://localhost:3000

# Testing with Multiple Users

Run the app locally or open your deployed link.

Open it in **two or more browsers (or devices)**.

Draw on one screen → updates appear **instantly** on all others.

## Test Features

-  Brush and eraser
-  Color and stroke width
-  Undo / Redo (global)
-  Live user list and cursor indicators

 Works on **Chrome**, **Firefox**, and **Safari**.

---

## Known Limitations / Bugs

-  Minor delay (~100–200 ms) depending on network latency.
-  Undo/Redo actions apply **globally across users**.
-  Free Render tier may cause **short startup delay after inactivity**.
-  Canvas is **not persistent** (refresh clears drawings).

## Time Spent

| Task | Time |
|------|------|
| Canvas implementation & drawing tools | 4 hours |
| Real-time synchronization (Socket.IO) | 5 hours |
| Undo/Redo + user management | 3 hours |
| UI design & styling | 2 hours |
| Debugging & deployment (Render) | 3 hours |
| **Total** | **~17 hours** |

##  Future Improvements

-  Add persistent canvas saving using **MongoDB** or **Firebase**.
-  Implement **authentication** and individual user profiles.
-  Support **multiple “rooms”** for separate drawing sessions.
-  Integrate **latency visualization** (ping/fps monitor).
-  Improve **mobile touch support** and optimize drawing performance.
